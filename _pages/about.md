Hello there! 👋🏻

I am a Brazilian QA Engineer currently living in Portugal, with more than ten years of experience in the software development industry. I have experience in both manual and automated testing, with proficiency in API and UI tests using Java, JavaScript, and PHP.

Beyond my passion for technology, I have centered my life around Jesus, which brings me great fulfillment. I also love traveling, cooking, reading, hiking, and watching dorama.

The stories I will be sharing here will likely revolve around my current projects or topics I'm studying, mostly related to software testing. I hope you find them enjoyable!
